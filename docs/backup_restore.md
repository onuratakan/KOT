# Backup and Restore
In here we will learn how to backup and restore databases. Let's backup a database.

```python
from kot import KOT

my_location_db = KOT("locations_of_team_members")

location_db_backup_address = my_location_db.backup(".")
print(location_db_backup_address)

my_location_db.restore(location_db_backup_address)

```

Output:

```console
./2023_06_01_18_36_40.KOT
```
